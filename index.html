    <h1>INFORMATION ABOUT ME</h1>
    <p>Hello everyone!</p>
    <p>Hello everyone, I am Mete Hakan Ceyhan. I was born on August 1, 2004, in Adana. I am the eldest child in a family with two children. I completed my education from primary school to high school at Ã–zel Adana Final Schools, and I graduated from Final Science High School with the third-place award. I took the university entrance exam twice, and in my second attempt, I earned a spot in the Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Hacettepe University, ranking 12th. I am currently in the second semester of my first year. I have briefly introduced myself, and I hope this text contains sufficient information.</p>
    
    <h2>HOMEWORK 1</h2>
    <h3>Q1 - The Preparation Process Of My Website</h3>
    <p>To be honest, since this was my first time opening a website with my own efforts, I had a little difficulty while doing it, but I enjoyed every moment of difficulty thanks to the effort I put in and the information I received. While creating my site, I transferred the codes I wrote to the Word file using Dev C and CodeBlock applications. I turned these into regular texts, then I created my page on GitHub by turning this text into an index.html file. However, for the beginning of a professional look, I obtained a QR code from one of the QR code sites that reached the URL of my site and added it to my report in my file with my link.</p>
    
    <p>My website link: <a href="https://metehakanceyhan.github.io/meteceyhan.github.io/" target="_blank">https://metehakanceyhan.github.io/meteceyhan.github.io/</a></p>
